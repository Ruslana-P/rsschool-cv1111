## About me
I started my career path while a student at the Faculty of Management (Specialisation Tourism and hotel business). Throughout all years of my studies, I worked part-time in various places as a bartender/waiter to gain practical skills on par with my university education. In fact, in the 4th year of my studies, I took my first managerial position — a manager in a small cafe in Kharkiv.
After graduating from university, my career path continued to be closely related to the domain of Hotel Business and Tourism. But after several years of full-time employment in this domain, I realized that I can not see my future in this field.
In 2016, I moved to the sales department at the SZB company, which became a significant milestone in my professional development and understanding of my abilities. The company that hired me was small, which automatically makes employees multitask. It allowed me to develop not just sales and document management skills, but also warehouse inventory management, administration, procurement, and billing skills.
In 2021, I started my second university education path at the Faculty of Media and Communication, specializing in Media and Informatics. Studying there led me to learn the basics of creating Internet pages.
To my surprise, the topic interested me so much that I didn't even notice how I went from learning the basics of HTML to one of the programming languages.
The new direction turned out to be much deeper and more complex than it seemed at the beginning, but this fact caused me only the interest and excitement of a new challenge in my life.
At the moment, I have completed the basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript course from the University of Michigan and I am completing Front-End Pro at It-school Hillel and Kharkiv.
I have always preferred learning by doing, and in the IT field, it seems to be the only realistic way of learning. Therefore, I am currently looking for an intern position.
I could call my level of knowledge related to Front-End Development basic, but my level of motivation is the highest possible. I have a high level of adaptation to new conditions, and I learn quickly. In addition to my professional path, I have always been involved in social activities - volunteering at cultural mass events, which helped me develop my communication skills, and teamwork, and significantly improved my language skills.
